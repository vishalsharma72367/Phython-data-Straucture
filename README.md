Q.1 Discuss string slicing and provide examples

String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract specific parts of a string using indices. Here's a detailed explanation with examples:

*Basic Slice Syntax*

`string[start:end]`

- `start`: The initial index of the substring (inclusive).
- `end`: The final index of the substring (exclusive).

*Examples*

1. *Simple Slice*

`my_string = "Hello, World!"`
`print(my_string[0:5])`  # Output: "Hello"

1. *Omitting Start or End Index*

`my_string = "Hello, World!"`
`print(my_string[:5])`   # Output: "Hello" (start index omitted)
`print(my_string[7:])`   # Output: "World!" (end index omitted)

1. *Negative Indices*

`my_string = "Hello, World!"`
`print(my_string[-6:-1])`  # Output: "World" (negative indices)

1. *Step Parameter*

`my_string = "Hello, World!"`
`print(my_string[::2])`   # Output: "Hlo ol!" (step size 2)

1. *Reversing a String*

`my_string = "Hello, World!"`
`print(my_string[::-1])`  # Output: "!dlroW ,olleH" (reverse the string)

1. *Slice Assignment*

`my_string = "Hello, World!"`
`my_string[0:5] = "Goodbye"`
`print(my_string)`  # Output: "Goodbye, World!"

These examples demonstrate various ways to use string slicing in Python. Remember that indices start at 0, and the end index is exclusive. You can also use negative indices to count from the end of the string.

Q.2 Explain the key features of lists in Python

In Python, lists are a fundamental data structure that offers a lot of flexibility and functionality. Here are the key features of lists:

1. *Ordered Collection*: Lists are an ordered collection of items, meaning that the order of the items matters and is maintained.

2. *Mutable*: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation (e.g., add, remove, or change elements).

3. *Dynamic Size*: Lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

4. *Heterogeneous*: Lists can contain elements of different data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans, other lists).

5. *Indexing*: Lists support indexing, allowing access to individual elements by their index (position in the list).

6. *Slicing*: Lists support slicing, allowing extraction of subsets of elements.

7. *Methods*: Lists have various built-in methods for common operations (e.g., append, extend, insert, remove, sort, reverse).

8. *Nested Lists*: Lists can contain other lists (nested lists), enabling complex data structures.

Some common list methods include:

- `append(element)`: Adds an element to the end.
- `extend(iterable)`: Adds multiple elements from an iterable.
- `insert(index, element)`: Inserts an element at a specified position.
- `remove(element)`: Removes the first occurrence of an element.
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the list.

These features make lists a versatile and essential data structure in Python.

Q.3 Describe how to access, modify, and delete elements in a list with examples

how to access, modify, and delete elements in a list with examples:

*Accessing Elements*

- Indexing: `list[index]`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list[0]` returns `1` (first element)
        - `my_list[4]` returns `5` (last element)
- Negative Indexing: `list[-index]`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list[-1]` returns `5` (last element)
        - `my_list[-5]` returns `1` (first element)
- Slicing: `list[start:stop:step]`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list[1:3]` returns `[2, 3]` (elements at index 1 and 2)

*Modifying Elements*

- Assignment: `list[index] = new_value`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list[0] = 10` changes the first element to `10`
- Append: `list.append(element)`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list.append(6)` adds `6` to the end
- Extend: `list.extend(iterable)`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list.extend([6, 7, 8])` adds multiple elements to the end
- Insert: `list.insert(index, element)`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list.insert(2, 10)` inserts `10` at index `2`

*Deleting Elements*

- Remove: `list.remove(element)`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list.remove(3)` removes the first occurrence of `3`
- Pop: `list.pop(index)`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list.pop(0)` removes and returns the first element (`1`)
- Del: `del list[index]`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `del my_list[0]` removes the first element
- Clear: `list.clear()`
    - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
        - `my_list.clear()` removes all elements

Remember to handle index errors and other exceptions when working with lists!

Q.4 Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples

Tuples and lists are both data structures in Python that can store multiple values. However, they have some key differences:

*Similarities:*

- Both can store multiple values
- Both are ordered, meaning the order of elements matters
- Both support indexing and slicing

*Differences:*

- *Immutability:* Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation. Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified.
- *Syntax:* Tuples use parentheses `()` and lists use square brackets `[]`
- *Use cases:* Tuples are used for data that shouldn't be changed, like constants or database records. Lists are used for data that needs to be modified, like user input or dynamic data.

*Examples:*

- *Tuple:*
    - `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
    - `my_tuple[0]` returns `1`
    - Trying to modify a tuple will raise an error: `my_tuple[0] = 10` raises `TypeError`
- *List:*
    - `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    - `my_list[0]` returns `1`
    - Modifying a list is allowed: `my_list[0] = 10` changes the first element to `10`

*When to use each:*

- Use tuples for:
    - Constants or unchanging data
    - Database records or data that shouldn't be modified
    - Data that needs to be hashed (tuples are hashable, lists are not)
- Use lists for:
    - Dynamic data that needs to be modified
    - User input or data that changes frequently
    - Data that needs to be sorted or manipulated

Q.5 Describe the key features of sets and provide examples of their use

Sets are a fundamental data structure in Python, offering efficient storage and operations for unique elements. Here are the key features of sets and examples of their use:

_Key Features:_

1. _Unordered Collection_: Sets are an unordered collection of unique elements.

2. _Adding Elements:_
    - `my_set.add(6)`
    - `my_set.update([7, 8, 9])` (add multiple elements)
3. _Removing Elements:_
    - `my_set.remove(4)`
    - `my_set.discard(10)` (remove without raising an error if absent)
4. _Membership Testing:_
    - `2 in my_set` returns `True`
    - `10 in my_set` returns `False`
5. _Set Operations:_
    - `union`: `my_set.union({6, 7, 8})` returns `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`
    - `intersection`: `my_set.intersection({4, 5, 6})` returns `{4, 5}`
    - `difference`: `my_set.difference({4, 5, 6})` returns `{1, 2, 3}`
    - `symmetric_difference`: `my_set.symmetric_difference({4, 5, 6})` returns `{1, 2, 3, 6}`

_Use Cases:_

1. _Unique Data Storage_: Sets ensure unique elements, making them suitable for storing unique IDs, usernames, or email addresses.
2. _Fast Lookups_: Sets provide efficient membership testing, making them ideal for caching, validation, or access control.
3. _Set Operations_: Sets support various operations, making them useful for data analysis, filtering, or combining datasets.

In summary, sets offer efficient storage and operations for unique elements, making them a valuable data structure in Python.

Q.6 Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming

Tuples and sets are two fundamental data structures in Python, each with unique characteristics and use cases.

*Tuples:*

1. *Immutable data storage*: Tuples are ideal for storing data that shouldn't be modified, such as database records, constants, or configuration settings.
2. *Fast and memory-efficient*: Tuples are faster and more memory-efficient than lists, making them suitable for large datasets or performance-critical applications.

1. *Data processing and analysis*: Both tuples and sets are useful for data processing, analysis, and manipulation.
2. *Data storage and retrieval*: Both can be used for storing and retrieving data, with tuples providing immutability and sets ensuring uniqueness.
3. *Performance-critical applications*: Both tuples and sets can improve performance in critical applications due to their efficiency and speed.

Q.7 Describe how to add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary with examples

how to add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary with examples:

*Adding Items:*

1. *Direct Assignment:* `dict[key] = value`
    - Example: `my_dict = {}; my_dict['name'] = 'John'`
2. *Update Method:* `dict.update({key: value})`
    - Example: `my_dict = {}; my_dict.update({'name': 'John'})`
3. *Setdefault Method:* `dict.setdefault(key, default_value)`
    - Example: `my_dict = {}; my_dict.setdefault('name', 'John')`

*Modifying Items:*

1. *Direct Assignment:* `dict[key] = new_value`
    - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John'}; my_dict['name'] = 'Jane'`
2. *Update Method:* `dict.update({key: new_value})`
    - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John'}; my_dict.update({'name': 'Jane'})`

*Deleting Items:*

1. *Del Statement:* `del dict[key]`
    - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John'}; del my_dict['name']`
2. *Pop Method:* `dict.pop(key)`
    - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John'}; my_dict.pop('name')`
3. *Popitem Method:* `dict.popitem()`
    - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John'}; my_dict.popitem()`
4. *Clear Method:* `dict.clear()`
    - Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John'}; my_dict.clear()`

Note:

- When using `del` or `pop`, if the key doesn't exist, a `KeyError` is raised.
- When using `popitem`, if the dictionary is empty, a `KeyError` is raised.
- When using `clear`, all items are removed, leaving an empty dictionary.

Q.8 Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.

In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable, meaning their value cannot change after creation. This is crucial for several reasons:

1. *Hashing*: Dictionary keys are hashed to store and retrieve values efficiently. Immutable keys ensure consistent hashing, allowing for fast lookups.
2. *Uniqueness*: Immutable keys guarantee uniqueness, preventing duplicate keys and ensuring accurate value retrieval.
3. *Performance*: Immutable keys enable dictionaries to cache hash values, reducing the overhead of repeated hash calculations.

Examples of immutable types suitable for dictionary keys:

1. *Integers*: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
2. *Floats*: `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`, etc.
3. *Strings*: `'hello'`, `'world'`, etc.
4. *Tuples*: `(1, 2, 3)`, `('a', 'b', 'c')`, etc. (Note: Tuples containing mutable elements are not suitable)

Examples of mutable types that cannot be used as dictionary keys:

1. *Lists*: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`, etc.
2. *Dictionaries*: `{'a': 1}`, `{'b': 2}`, etc.
3. *Sets*: `{1, 2, 3}`, `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`, etc.

Attempting to use a mutable type as a dictionary key raises a `TypeError`:
```
my_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: 'value'}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```
In summary, the immutability of dictionary keys ensures efficient, accurate, and performant data storage and retrieval in Python dictionaries.
